"""
Let's create a program along the lines of the example above. 
This program should print out the message "hi" and then ask "Shall we continue?" until the user inputs "no". 
Then the program should print out "okay then" and finish. Please have a look at the example below.

Sample output
hi
Shall we continue? yes
hi
Shall we continue? oui
hi
Shall we continue? jawohl
hi
Shall we continue? no
okay then

    answer = input("Shall we continue? ")
    if answer == "no":
        break
print("okay then")
 

#Review
My solution results in same output, but the suggested one print the final message after the loop ends,
which is maybe better and a cleaner way to handle post-loop statements and add additional post-loop logic later on.
